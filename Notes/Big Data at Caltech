Yahoo and Hadoop
    Big-Data Applications
        Yahoo's Weather App

            Images are automatically tagged
            Yahoo Vision Kit
                    Color and object detection
Big-Data Innovations
    Apache Storm
        Used for real time processing
        Data is streamed in then each bolt is doing work on the data
        ? Are each process doing computation on the same data?
        ? How do you handle scheduling jobs?
    Apache HBase
        NoSQL Database for Hadoop
    CaffeOnSpark
