Q/A with Eddie
    ? How do you save a failing conversation?
        If it goes south then let it go. Try to have another conservation at a later time.
    ? When did you gain a passion for networking?
        Realized after high school that he had to push hard to get to where he wants to be. Set a goal, and change the plan for it if needed.
    ? How do you gauge the appropriate time to network?
        If they look busy, don't do it.
        If alone then go for it!
